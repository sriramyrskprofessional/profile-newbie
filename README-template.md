## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Background properties


### What I learned

1.I learned that we can add svg not only in html code but also through background css
2.I learnt that changing the values in dev options saves time
3.Recalled about postion properties

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.first-svg {
  background: url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg");}
```



### Continued development
I further want to focus on not making my code messy
